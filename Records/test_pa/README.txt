README file for .csv files of the species observations at PA sites (“test_pa”)
These files are part of the data publication: Elith, J., Graham, C.H., Valavi, R., Abegg, M., Bruce, C., Ferrier, S., Ford, A., Guisan, A., Hijmans, R.J., Huettmann, F., Lohmann, L.G., Loiselle, B.A., Moritz, C., Overton, J.McC., Peterson, A.T., Phillips, S., Richardson, K., Williams, S., Wiser, S.K., Wohlgemuth, T. & Zimmermann, N.E. (2020) Presence-only and presence-absence data for comparing species distribution modeling methods. Biodiversity Informatics 15:69-80

These files provide group, site ids, site locations, and species observations at each of the presence-absence sites in each region, intended for evaluation of predictions made to these sites using the test_env files found in /test_env. 

The first 4 columns give the group, site id, and x and y locations - these are in identical order to their matched counterparts in test_env.
The following columns contain, per species, presence and absence observations, coded 1 and 0 respectively. 
Species codes match those in the train_po files, and explained in the report cited above.
