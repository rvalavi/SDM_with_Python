Code,Description,Units,Continous (Cont) or Categorical (Cat),Notes
cti,compound topographic index- a quantification of the position of a site in the local landscape,number (dimensionless index),Cont,"Often referred to as the steady state wetness index; defined as: CTI = ln ( As / tanB ), where 'As' is the specific catchment area expressed as m2 per unit width orthogonal to the flow direction and 'B' is the slope angle"
disturb,"disturbance (clearing, logging etc)",number (ordinal),Cont,index. 1 = light to 4 = heavy
mi,moisture index.,number (dimensionless index),Cont,"Index of site wetness derived from a water balance algorithm using rainfall, evaporation, radiation and soil depth as inputs. Ranges between 0 (dry) and 100 (wet)"
rainann,mean annual rainfall,Mm,Cont,
raindq,mean rainfall of the driest quarter,Mm,Cont,
rugged,ruggedness,number (dimensionless index),Cont,Coefficient of variation of raster cells within 1km of cell of interest
soildepth,mean soil depth,m *1000,Cont,"predicted from a model relating sampled soil depths to climate, geology and topography"
soilfert,soil fertility,number (ordinal),Cont,class 1 (low) to 5 (high) derived from soil landscape mapping and modeling of geochemical data. Ordered; can be treated as continuous
solrad,annual mean solar radiation,MJm-2 day-1 * 10,Cont,Terrain adjusted radiation
tempann,annual mean temperature,°C * 10,Cont,
tempmin,minimum temperature of the coldest month,°C * 10,Cont,
topo,topographic position,m,Cont,"Mean difference in elevation between raster cell of interest and all cells within 1km radius (-ve values are gullies, +ve are ridges)"
vegsys,broad vegetation type,number (category),Cat,1 = Rainforest; 2 = Moist open forest; 3 = Dry open forest; 4 = Woodland; 5 = Coastal sclerophyll complex; 6 = Plateau sclerophyll complex; 7 = Disturbed remnant; 8 = Exotic (pine) plantation; 9 = Cleared
